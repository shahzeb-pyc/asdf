-- Billing audit fix 2026-11-01 (fix 1): worker claim/publish
-- checks for an active, non-superseded period.
--
-- UNAPPLIED: apply manually on the owner's tap, like every migration.
--
-- At expiry or refund-drop, queued posts PAUSE: they stay queued and
-- are never claimed. On renewal they RESUME claiming at future
-- slots; missed slots stay lost (the slot claimer's window rule is
-- untouched) and there is no flood. Admin owners are exempt
-- (admins never buy plans).
--
-- This is a full CREATE OR REPLACE of both claim functions, so
-- applying it is correct on top of either the 20261030140000 due
-- claim body or the 20261031030000 slot claim body: every other
-- gate (account status, token expiry, cooldown, window, D5
-- deferral, ranked selection) is carried over verbatim, and only
-- the entitlement predicate below is added. Existing EXECUTE
-- grants are preserved by CREATE OR REPLACE; the due-claim
-- REVOKE/GRANT lines from the base file are repeated explicitly.
-- Safe to apply at any time: it only narrows which rows a claim
-- may take, and never changes a function signature the worker
-- calls.

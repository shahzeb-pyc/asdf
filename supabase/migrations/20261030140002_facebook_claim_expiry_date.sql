-- =============================================================================
-- Migration: 20261030140000_facebook_claim_expiry_date.sql
-- Audit BG4 remainder (narrow, after BG1/BG2 propagation): the worker
-- date-vs-status disagreement. A Facebook account whose
-- token_expires_at has passed but whose status is still 'active'
-- (refresh job missed a cycle) could still be claimed, then fail
-- terminally on a Graph 190 auth error instead of deferring.
-- CHANGE (signature UNCHANGED): claim_due_queue_items additionally
-- requires, for platform 'facebook' only, that token_expires_at is
-- NULL or in the future. Other platforms are untouched (their tokens
-- may be refreshable).
-- BASE (corrected 2026-10-30, PR-stage catch): this body is the
-- spec 138 GROUPED implementation from 20261022140000 verbatim plus
-- the BG4 condition in both due-selection clauses (snapshot
-- due_destinations and pass-(c) ranked_due). An earlier revision of
-- this migration copied the pre-spec-121 correlated body from
-- 20261022120000 section 6a instead, silently reverting the grouped
-- D5 deferral/headroom computation — the claim parity rig caught it
-- (all cases failed on the correlated body). Do NOT rebase this file
-- on anything older than 20261022140000.
-- ACLs are re-asserted below, as in the source migration.
-- PROD APPLICATION PENDING: this migration is NOT applied to prod by
-- this branch; it must be applied manually, separately, after merge.
-- It was NOT executed against live Postgres in this environment
-- (no local Postgres binary); correctness is established by the
-- spec 138 claim parity rig in CI, which runs this migration file.
